#' Compute Moment of force

#' Compute the moment of gravity force Mf and the moment of gravity force relative to cylinder radius Mf_r from an object of class aRchi.

#' @rdname Compute_Mf
#' @param aRchi an object of class aRchi with at least the QSM and the paths table.
#' @param WoodDensity a numeric or a data.table. A single wood density value for the whole tree or one value per cylinder in kg/m3. If wood density is given for each cylinder a data.table with two column (i.e cyl_ID and WoodDensity) must be given.
#' @return The aRchi file with the QSM slot having three new columns: the biomass upstream the cylinder \code{sub_tree_biomass}, the moment of gravity force \code{Mf} and the moment of gravity force relative to cylinder radius \code{Mf_r}.
#' @details
#'
#' The moment of gravity force (i.e \code{Mf}) is calculated at each cylinder position. \code{Mf} can be seen as a proxy of the mechanical loading history due to gravity at a given position of a tree.
#' This quantity is defined by the following the equation: Mf=R*F where R is the lever arm, which is the norm of the horizontal vector between the position where \code{Mf} is measured (i.e a cylinder) and the position where the force is applied (i.e., the center of mass, G, of the whole structure upstream a cylinder: a subtree).
#'
#' The mass of the cylinders are needed to calculate the center of mass and are estimated using their volume and the wood density provided in argument \code{WoodDensity}. Finally, F is the weight of the subtree: F=g*M	with g the standard acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m.s-Â²).
#'
#' The moment of gravity force relative (i.e \code{Mf_r}) to cylinder radius r is also computed following the formula: Mf_r = Mf/r^3
