\title{Simplify a skeleton by removing unnecessary cylinders}
\usage{
simplify_skeleton(aRchi, seg_length = 0.1)

\S4method{simplify_skeleton}{aRchi}(aRchi, seg_length = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{aRchi}{an object of class aRchi containing at least a QSM.}

\item{seg_length}{numeric. The target maximal cylinder length. See details.}
}
\value{
a aRchi file with the simplified QSM.
}
\description{
Simplify a skeleton by removing unnecessary cylinders
}
\details{
Simplifies a QSM by merging short cylinders into longer cylinders with
         a length close to a user defined target length. Note that short cylinders are
         kept if they support a branching point so that the overall QSM geometry
         is not affected by the simplification process.

# import a point cloud
