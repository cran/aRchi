\description{
Generate foliage to a QSM or skeleton with segmented annual shoots.
}
\details{
Allometries for the leaf area, number of leaves and number of internodes are computed
         at the annual shoot level and are of the form \emph{X = a*AS_length^b}. The leaves elevation angle
         is constant if a single value is provided for \code{elev} or is linearly interpolated based
         of the leaf relative height within the tree crown if two values are provided.
