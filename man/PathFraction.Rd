\title{Compute the path fraction}
\usage{
PathFraction(aRchi)

\S4method{PathFraction}{aRchi}(aRchi)
}
\arguments{
\item{aRchi}{an object of class aRchi with at least the QSM and the Paths table}
}
\value{
The path fraction
}
\description{
Compute from an object of class aRchi the path fraction
}
\details{
The path fraction is the ratio between the mean path length and the maximum path length.
}
\examples{
# Read an aRchi file with at least the QSM and the paths table
file=system.file("extdata","Tree_1_aRchi.aRchi",package = "aRchi")
Tree1_aRchi=read_aRchi(file)

PathFraction(Tree1_aRchi)
