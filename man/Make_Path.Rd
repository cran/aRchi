\title{Make the path of a QSM in an aRchi object}
\usage{
Make_Path(aRchi)

\S4method{Make_Path}{aRchi}(aRchi)
}
\arguments{
\item{aRchi}{a file of class aRchi}
}
\value{
The aRchi object with the table of paths
}
\description{
Identify and record the paths of a QSM in an object of class aRchi. The path are needed for several tree metrics estimation of the aRchi package.
}
\details{
A path is a continuous succession of cylinders from a terminal segment (i.e a branch tip) to the trunk base. Thus, there is as many path as terminal segments in a QSM.

This function fill the slot Paths of an object of class aRchi with a data.table of the paths. This data.table contains the same variables as a classic QSM plus an ID_path column. This table is thus larger than the QSM table as each cylinder is repeated as many times as it appears in a path. For example, the first cylinder of the QSM (i.e the beginning of the trunk) is repeated N path times, with N path the number of path of the QSM.

Many function of the aRchi packages request a path table (check see also).

# Read a QSM file

# Build an object of class aRchi
Tree1_aRchi<-build_aRchi(QSM=QSM)

# Make the path table
Tree1_aRchi<-Make_Path(Tree1_aRchi)
