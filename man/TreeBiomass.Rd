\title{Tree biomass estimation of the woody part}
\usage{
TreeBiomass(aRchi, WoodDensity, level = "Tree")

\S4method{TreeBiomass}{aRchi}(aRchi, WoodDensity = NULL, level = "Tree")
}
\arguments{
\item{aRchi}{an object of class aRchi with at least a QSM}

\item{WoodDensity}{a numeric or a data.table. A single wood density value for the whole tree or one value per cylinder in kg/m3. If wood density is given for each cylinder a data.table with two column (i.e cyl_ID and WoodDensity) must be given.}

\item{level}{character. The level at which the wood biomass is computed. \code{Tree}, \code{branching_order} or \code{Axis}.}
}
\value{
a numeric or data.table. The wood biomass in Kg at the requested level
}
\description{
Compute the tree wood biomass at different level of organization
}
\examples{
# Read an aRchi file with at least a QSM
file=system.file("extdata","Tree_1_aRchi.aRchi",package = "aRchi")
Tree1_aRchi=read_aRchi(file)
# Compute the whole tree wood biomass.
TreeBiomass(Tree1_aRchi,WoodDensity=550)
