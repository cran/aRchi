\description{
Detect and add the axes that were not reconstructed by the QSM method
}
\details{
This function detects the non reconstructed axes by analyzing the point cloud distance to the skeleton.
          In a first step, the distance of each point to the skeleton is computed. At this step, the
          points that are too far from the skeleton can be removed with the parameter \code{max_dist}.
          The relative distance of the points is then computed by dividing their respective distance by
          the average distance of all the points within axes sections of a given length (\code{sec_length}). The
          points that are far from the skeleton (in terms of relative distance) are then considered as
          being part of a non reconstructed axis (NR). To do so two parameters are available. First, the
          \code{method} parameter defines which method should be used to identify the NR points and \code{th}
          sets the threshold to use. If \code{method = "absolute"} then \code{th} is a cut-off distance
          for the relative distance (1 being the average distance). If \code{method = "statistical"} then
          \code{th} is a multiplier of the standard deviation so that the points further than th*sd (sd = the
          standard deviation of the distribution of relative distances) are considered as NR points. NR axes are then
          segmented by clustering the NR points based on distance. To do so, the \code{d_clust} parameter
          sets the minimal distance between two points to be considered as part of two different axes. The
          NR axes are then reconstructed as a single segment.

\note{
The tree topology is fully recomputed. Therefore any existing topology will be lost. It is thus recommended
      to use this function at the beginning of the processing pipeline.
